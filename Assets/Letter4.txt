Dear Miss Geuinever,
A wondrous thought came to my mind this morning! Perchance you have no mirrors in your tower with which to witness thine own beauty. What madness, what cruelty indeed, to hold you back from the most beautiful image in the lands, as is thy face. While this may do it no justice at all, allow me to pen a poem for you, to try and describe to you the most amazing woman in the world.
A sweet flower,
With gossamer arms stretched outwards towards the ocean
As vast and deep as the soul of all mankind, and blue, blue orbs of sapphire. 
Silken locks of golden silk, spun from Rumpelstiltskinâ€™s own magic loom 
And perchance more, perchance, perchance, behind the snow white smile
Her rosy lips parting in the softest of curves
The ocean waves accept all tributes
In her endless glory.

Patiently yours, 
Alexander Princetonne of Dukeington, the third, wordsmith
