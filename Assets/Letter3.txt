My Dearest Ginny,
Or do you prefer Guinever? Forgive my forwardness, my darling, but I am simply compelled to continue writing to you as, despite my best efforts, the pen in my hand cannot be stilled, nor can my inkwell run dry as it refuses to be quenched as I pull from it again and again to write these missives in the hopes of speaking with you once more. Just once more, is all I ask, truely! What are you thinking up there, hidden away in your tower? It has been so, so long since you joined us mere mortals down upon the earth’s surface, so much that the grass itself yearns for the tickle of your light footsteps to welcome in the beginning of spring, rebirth, renewal, and life. My winter cold heart aches from your absence, a fast I haven’t managed to break, but my spirit remains strong; I will wait until you are ready, my love. Until my words melt your ice cold heart, to create the joyous waterfalls of our devotion to each other. It will be a sight to behold, and I looke forward to sharing it with you.
Your Love, 
Alexander Priceton of Dukeington, the third, poet in training
