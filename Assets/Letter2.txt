My Darling Guinever, 
You were in my thoughts today, as I went about my routines. Seemingly everything reminds me of you now, and I yearn to hear your laughter echo down the halls, as they do in my dreams every night. You float down the halls like a hauntingly wonderful spector, a guardian angel watching over my dreams with the gentle brush of your hands. The sweetest honey cannot begin to compare to the sound of your voice singing in the evenings, I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if an invading army were stopped in their tracks by your delicate songs! I can hear you sing every evening from your garden, when I watch the moon rise over the far hill. Beautiful, but always just out of reach. One day, perhaps, your moon and my sun will eclipse and cast a beautiful shadow of love across the entire realm, for all to bask in its majesty. 
Until then,
Alexender Priceton of Dukeington, the third, knight in absentia
