My Love, Guienever,
With your beauty acting as my muse, please accept this humble offering in your honor:
My lovely star so bright against the night,
Outshinin’ all who dare to flaunt their might.
A beauty that’s found only in her light,
A step, her footfalls, a cure for my sight.
Perchance it wrong , ad’mired so small a thing,
Soft pearls have ne’er the chance to sing to me.
But soft! For now I hear their gentle ring,
A pale ankle lifted for me to see.
Is this not Fate who’s answered my last call?
A chance I must take, no matter how small. 
Waiting with open arms,
Yours truely,
Alex Princetone of Dukington, the third
